<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Boston Housing Project involves predicting the prices of houses in various neighborhoods of Boston based on a dataset that includes several features affecting house values. This is a classic regression problem widely used for understanding linear regression models and techniques in machine learning.

Dataset Overview
The Boston Housing dataset contains data points about houses and neighborhoods in Boston. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (medv), while the features include:

* crim: Per capita crime rate by town.
* zn: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.
* indus: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
* chas: Charles River dummy variable (1 if the tract bounds the river, 0 otherwise).
* nox: Nitric oxide concentration.
* rm: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
* age: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
* dis: Weighted distances to employment centers.
* rad: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
* tax: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
* ptratio: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* black: Proportion of the population identifying as Black.
* lstat: Percentage of the population considered lower status.
* medv: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable).

<!-- PROJECT GOALS -->
## Project Goals

The primary goal of the Boston Housing Project is to predict the median value of homes (medv) based on the other attributes in the dataset. The project helps demonstrate various stages of a machine learning pipeline:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling, and removing irrelevant columns).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the relationships between features and the target variable, identifying patterns, outliers, and correlations.
3. Model Training: Applying a linear regression model to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable.
4. Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to measure the model's performance.
5. Visualization: Plotting predictions against actual values to visualize how well the model performs.

<!-- WHY IT'S IMPORTANT -->
## Why It Is Important

* Understanding Housing Markets: It provides insights into the factors influencing housing prices, such as crime rates, proximity to highways, air quality, and educational resources.
* Feature Engineering: The project can showcase various methods for improving models, such as adding interaction terms, feature scaling, and transforming skewed data.
* Interpretable Models: Linear regression is a highly interpretable model, meaning we can directly understand the impact of each feature on housing prices.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

<!-- CHALLENGES IN THE PROJECT -->
## Challenges in the Project

* Non-Linear Relationships: Some features may have non-linear relationships with the target variable, which might make linear regression insufficient without proper feature engineering or transformation.
* Outliers: The presence of outliers, such as extreme values for crime rates or house prices, can heavily influence the model, leading to poor predictions.
* Multicollinearity: Features may be highly correlated, which can distort the model's performance in linear regression.

<!-- APPLICATIONS -->
## Applications

* Real Estate Analytics: This project is valuable for understanding factors that affect property values, helping homeowners, buyers, and real estate agents.
* Urban Planning: The insights gained from analyzing features like pollution levels, crime rates, and distance to employment centers can aid urban planners in improving cities.
